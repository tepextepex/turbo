#### Bulk aerodynamic method
Bulk aerodynamic method is one of the ways to estimate turbulent heat exchange between the atmosphere and the Earth surface.

It doesn't require any complex equipment such as eddie covariance flux towers. However, it is quite demanding for the input data.

You should obtain temperature, humidity and wind speed at two layers: just above the surface and at a certain height above (e.g. 2 meters). 
Atmospheric pressure is needed as well.

This method is well-known and is commonly used in studies of energy balance.
